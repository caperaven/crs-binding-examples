<p>
    crs-binding examples application.<br/>
    This application uses two main components from crs
</p>

<ul>
    <li>crs-binding</li>
    <li>crs-router</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All navigation is handled by crs-router.<br/>
    All binding is handled by crs-binding.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of this application is to document features of crs-binding using examples of how you can use it.
    These examples are not meant to be the end all and be all of web development.
    They are short little samples demonstrating how you could achieve certain things.
