# Radio Group

## Introduction
Working with radio buttons is not always the most fun you have ever had.  
To simplify the experience crs-binding has a particular repeat syntax that manages the radio group for you.  
This example shows off two groups and automatically updating a property based on the selection made.

It is recommended you read the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding-documentation/blob/master/4.%20repeat-ui.md#radio-groups">documentation</a> to understand what the binding does on your behalf.
